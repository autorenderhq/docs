title: 'Upload File with Token'
openapi: 'POST /api/v1/uploads/{token}'
---

## Overview

Upload a file directly using the token generated by the Generate Browser Upload Token endpoint. The token is supplied as a URL path parameter. This endpoint accepts raw binary image data (not multipart form data) and creates the upload record during the upload operation.

---

## Why

**Complete the token-based upload workflow.** The Upload File with Token endpoint allows client-side applications to upload files using the secure token generated by your backend. This completes the secure upload workflow where tokens are generated server-side and used by clients to upload files without exposing API keys.

## Features

- **Token-based upload**: Upload files using the secure token without exposing API keys
- **Raw binary data**: Accepts raw image binary data (not multipart form data)
- **Automatic filename detection**: Extracts filename from Content-Disposition header or derives from Content-Type
- **Policy enforcement**: Automatically enforces constraints (folder, tags, transformations, file size) encoded in the token
- **Format flexibility**: Accepts any image format (no format restrictions)
- **Upload record creation**: Creates the upload record during the upload operation

## Use Cases

- **Client-side uploads**: Upload files directly from web browsers or mobile apps using the generated token
- **Secure frontend uploads**: Enable uploads from frontend applications without exposing API keys
- **Token-based workflows**: Implement upload workflows where tokens are generated on the backend and used by clients
- **Mobile app uploads**: Enable direct uploads from mobile applications using secure tokens
