## Overview

The AutoRender API uses token-based authentication. You can generate an API token from your AutoRender workspace settings. Once you have your token, include it in the `Authorization` header of your API requests as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

## Managing API Tokens

You can manage your API tokens from your AutoRender workspace settings. Navigate to the API tokens section to create, view, and revoke your tokens.

### Create an API Token

To create a new API token, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your AutoRender workspace settings
2. Click on the "API tokens" section in the sidebar
3. Click the "Create API Token" button
4. Enter a descriptive name for your token to help you identify its purpose
5. Select an expiration period for the token
6. Click "Create" to generate your new API token

<Warning>
  Make sure to copy your API token immediately after creation, as it will only be displayed once for security reasons. Store it securely and never share it publicly.
</Warning>

### Revoke an API Token

To revoke an API token that you no longer need or that may have been compromised, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your AutoRender workspace settings
2. Click on the "API tokens" section in the sidebar
3. Find the API token you want to revoke in the list
4. Click the "Revoke" button next to the token
5. Confirm your password when prompted
6. Click "Revoke API token" to permanently delete the token

<Warning>
  Once an API token is revoked, it cannot be restored. Any applications using this token will immediately lose access to the API. Make sure to update your applications with a new token before revoking the old one if you need continued access.
</Warning>


<Note>
  The API token is stored securely as a SHA-256 hash in the database. The plain text token is never stored and cannot be retrieved after creation.
</Note>
