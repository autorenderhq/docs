## Why

**Essential for asset lifecycle management.** The Delete File endpoint allows you to remove unwanted files, manage storage costs, and maintain a clean asset library. It's a critical operation for asset management workflows and storage optimization.

## Features

- **Permanent deletion**: Removes file from both database and S3 storage
- **Atomic operation**: Ensures file is deleted from both locations or fails cleanly
- **S3 cleanup**: Automatically removes the file from S3 storage
- **Database cleanup**: Removes file record and associated metadata from the database
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles cases where file doesn't exist in S3
- **Workspace isolation**: Only deletes files from the authenticated workspace
